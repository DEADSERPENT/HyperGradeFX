## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why does it take a second to update when I adjust a slider?**
A: Compositor is processing the effect. Complex scenes = slightly slower. But you WILL see the update!

**Q: Can I adjust effects after applying?**
A: YES! All nodes stay in compositor. Click any node and adjust properties.

**Q: Can I combine multiple effects?**
A: ABSOLUTELY! Stack as many as you want. They process left-to-right.

**Q: How do I remove an effect?**
A: Select the node (or nodes) and press X → Delete.

**Q: Will this work on animations?**
A: YES! All effects work on animation. Scrub timeline to see.

**Q: Do I need to re-apply effects for each frame?**
A: NO! Once set up, effects apply to ALL frames automatically.
